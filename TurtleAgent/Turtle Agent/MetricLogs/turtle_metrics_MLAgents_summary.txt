PATH EFFICIENCY EXPLANATION:
Path Efficiency = Direct Distance / Actual Distance Traveled
• 100% = Perfect path (straight line to goal)
• 80% = Very efficient path (slight deviations)
• 50% = Moderate efficiency (some wandering)
• 20% = Low efficiency (much wandering/collisions)
• Values below 20% indicate significant inefficiency
• Calculation uses both path points and movement tracking
